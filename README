= current_gem - Maintain symlinks to the most recent versions of installed Ruby Gems.

== VERSION

This documentation refers to current_gem version 0.0.6


== DESCRIPTION

CurrentGem maintains symlinks to the most recent versions of your installed
Ruby Gems by hooking into the install and update process. Thus, you have a
stable path at your disposal that always points to the current version of
a gem.

This allows constructs like the following

  PassengerRoot /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/current/passenger

instead of

  PassengerRoot /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/passenger-2.2.7

which is likely to break if you update passenger and perform a gem cleanup
afterwards. If all you want is the most recent version and you don't care
about specific version numbers, just go for it.

=== Note

On platforms where symbolic links are not supported, this plugin will
simply do nothing at all. You can, however, use the symlink-independent
parts of the API (e.g., CurrentGem#find or CurrentGem#version_for).


== USAGE

=== Querying

In order to obtain a gem's current gemspec, call

  require 'current_gem'
  spec = CurrentGem[gem_name]

or run

  > gem spec <gem_name>

on the command line (this is a built-in command).

You can get a gem's current path programmatically with

  require 'current_gem'

  CurrentGem.path_for(gem_name)
  CurrentGem.path_for(spec)

or by running

  > gem current_path <gem_name>

on the command line (turn on the <tt>--resolve</tt>/<tt>-r</tt> switch to
resolve the link target).

Finally, get the gem's current version with

  require 'current_gem'

  CurrentGem.version_for(gem_name)
  CurrentGem.version_for(spec)

or by running

  > gem current_version <gem_name>

on the command line.

=== Updating

In case you want to update all symlinks at once (or you want to get started
after installing CurrentGem for the first time), call

  require 'current_gem'
  CurrentGem.update_all

or run

  > gem symlink_current

on the command line (turn on the <tt>--verbose</tt>/<tt>-V</tt> switch to see
the actual links).

Whenever you install or update any gems the symlinks will be created/updated
automatically. If you uninstall a gem, the symlink will be pointed at the most
recent remaining version or, if none are left, removed as well.
